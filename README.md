<p>Human activity can be observed and measured by employing different sensors on different parts of the body. An increase in the usage of wearable devices by people has led to increased research in Human Activity monitoring and analysis. This analysis has helped develop many technologies like fall detection, irregular heart rhythms, walking steadiness, posture, etc. This project focuses on classifying the activity performed by a human from time-series data generated from the user's phone's accelerometer. The time-series data is first converted into 2-D images and then fed to a CNN to learn five different activities from 4 features of the data. The project's primary focus is to leverage the predicting power of CNNs on time-series data with a small number of training samples and input channels. </p>
